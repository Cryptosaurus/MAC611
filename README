* This code includes:
- a generic C version (using 32+32->64 multiplier)
- a GNU C version (using 64+64->128 multiplier and 128-bit integers)
- an assembly version for ARM cortex-M0 (using 32+32->64 multiplier)
- an assembly version for ARM cortex-M3 (using 32+32->32 multiplier)

The C version can be compiler under Linux (tested on x86_64) The ARM
assembly versions have been tested with mbedOS, using the gcc compiler
(gcc 4 and gcc 7), with FDRM-K64F and FRDM-KL46Z boards.

* To compile with mbed OS, use the following:

pip install --user mbed-cli
cd armv7M-small
mbed new .
mbed target K64F
mbed toolchain GCC_ARM
mbed compile --profile release

* In order to compile with -O3 instead of -Os, you can do:

perl -pe 's/"-Os"/"-O3"/' mbed-os/tools/profiles/release.json > mbed-os/tools/profiles/fast.json
mbed compile --profile fast

* In order to reduce the size of mbedOS, you can create a file named
  mbed_app.json with the following content:

{
    "requires": ["bare-metal"]
}
